        <p><h3>Note:</h3> If you want you add some potatoes to this dish</p>

            <p><strong><li>Step1</li></p></strong>
            <p>Fill a large pot 1/2 full with water. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt, peppercorns, and the wine cork,</p> 
<p></p>Bring to a boil over high heat</p>


            <p><strong><li>Step2</li></p></strong>
            <p>Meanwhile, place octopus on a cutting board. Using a wooden spoon or meat mallet, <p>pound the octopus multiple times, starting in the middle and moving down each tentacle to tenderize the meat.</p>

            <p><strong><li>Step3</li></p></strong>
            <p>Dip tentacles into the boiling water 3 times, holding them in the boiling water 2 to 3 seconds each time, until the tentacles curl up.<p> Submerge entire octopus in the boiling water. Bring water back to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until octopus is fork-tender, 45 to 60 minutes.</p>Remove from heat and cool for 30 minutes.</p>

            <p><strong><li>Step4</li></p></strong></p>
            <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>


            <p><strong><li>Step5</li></p></strong>
            <p>rill octopus until charred on all sides, <strong>3 to 4 minutes per side.</strong></p>

            <p><strong><li>Step6</li></p></strong>
            <p>Remove from heat, slice into pieces, a</p>nd place on a serving platter.<p></p> Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and squeeze lemon over the top. <p>Sprinkle with parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.</p>
